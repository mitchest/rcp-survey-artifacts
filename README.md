This repo provides code and data to reproduce the analysis from:  
Foster, Hill and Lyons (accepted) "Ecological Grouping of Survey Sites when Sampling Artefacts are Present". Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics).  
DOI: xx.xxxxx/xxx  

Vegetation data originally from:  
http://www.bionet.nsw.gov.au/  

Sub-Antarctic Fish data originally from:  
Hill, N. and Lamb, T. (2015) HIMI Demersal Fish Update and Environmental Covariates.  
Australian Antarctic Data Centre  
doi:10.4225/15/5671FDEC717B4  

### Running code ###

* All code and files should be cloned/downloaded to a single path
* The Sub-Antarctic fish analysis can be run in full
* To properly reproduce the NSW vegetation data analysis, a cluster computer is almost certainly required (you'll need around 60-70 CPU days). If you do wish to perform such an analysis, the code and cluster scripts can be found at a separate repo: https://github.com/mitchest/rcp-cluster-parallelisation
* Otherwise, this repo contains a synthesised version of the NSW vegetation analysis so that the input data, model specifications and diagnostics can be explored  

### Contribution guidelines ###

* The best route for feed back on {RCPmod} is to lookup the function authors: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCPmod/index.html  
* Otherwise, feel free to suggest edits here
